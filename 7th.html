<p>Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011, severe natural disaster that occurred in northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011. This list includes the strongest earthquakes recorded in or around Japan by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)<br> in the past 14 days.
The event began with a powerful earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan’s main island, which caused widespread 
damage on land and initiated a series <br>
of large tsunami waves that devastated many coastal areas of the country,
most notably in the Tōhoku region (northeastern Honshu). The tsunami also instigated a major nuclear accident at a power station along the coast.<br>

<p>The magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck at 2:46 PM. (The early estimate of magnitude 8.9 was later revised upward.)<br>
The epicentre was located some 80 miles (130 km) east of the city of Sendai, Miyagi prefecture, and the focus occurred at a depth <br>
of 18.6 miles (about 30 km) below the floor of the western Pacific Ocean. The earthquake was caused by the rupture <br>
of a stretch of the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench, which separates the Eurasian Plate from the subducting Pacific Plate.<br>
